SpringFox Support
---------------

It will be necessary to copy the file `springdoc.properties` contained in the directory `/src/main/resources`
of this project, to your application's `/src/main/resources` directory, changing the values
of its properties according to the necessity.
Only copy this properties file, in case there is a change in the properties.
